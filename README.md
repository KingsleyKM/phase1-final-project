# phase1-final-project
Hello! 
On the project we were required to make a functional and interactive web application that with make it appealing to the user . 
The project incorporates the use of html,CSS ,JSON and javascript.It requires DOm manipulation where there should be three or more events in the web application (ie: click, DOMCONTENTLOADED etc.).
Using Fetch to get data from a public api. In my case i choose the https://cataas.com/#/ api which generates random images of cats. Which was successful . 
My goal was to create a button that can change the image of the cat displayed at each click. I thought of adding a previous and next button but since the images are generated at random the image ,it was impossible to implement this feature. Thus I made the random image button.
